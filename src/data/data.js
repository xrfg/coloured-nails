          Who will hold our unity today? We take turns, unwillingly. I've been
          saying i feel fragile lately but there is a portal, a purple and green
          one, it is fragile in its greens (dreams) and delicate in its purples,
          like something we know... like well tended gardens inside steamy soup
          of soft potato starch flavors. No need for a key, it's open! A shout
          to the window and a pack of street cats, i walk the street while they
          play with a stone. Mild stoners under pink taxi flower blankets
          laughing Christmas away air conditioned, very dry, so we compensate.

          polish, our main character
        </p>
        <p>
          a package for two coffees. Everyone has the right to move. Moving on,
          take it from the top, from the tip of your blue sky nail, cash and
          carry
        </p>
        <p>
          no rush - it is just a code. Are you on line? In line with your
          feelings? Clothes line and flowery vanilla smells, must be cheap, so i
          go inside. There are three models. Where are you going with this?
          Well, i think they have working pants. And that's hot. Do you wanna
          ask? Next stop coming soon, who will step into our intrigue? Or will
          it slowly empty out, leaving a cold porcelain-white lonely bathtub? No
          foam. What is really foam made of? Or not really... convince me
          lightly with credible fake facts. It is something hidden at first but
          it is there, already. It doesn't wait, it moves. It is stimulated. By
          the eye without danger? Which eye is that? Never met.

          intentions to live, she's watching us over the napperon curtains. Off
          season notice board, announcements of the end of the world - postponed
          until next summer. Babe it's happening already. There are no missiles
          in the water, this silence could not hold their passing through.
          Clothes line, we're washing... I can't believe it's 24 degrees in

          the creatures join the movement, since before writing because before
          writing we used to sing. Against the dogs in favour of flowers. The
          temperature tower bears several drums, silently they announce that the
          boat isn't coming. Austere rocks and two small pebbles, solidified in
          a crust of sea salt. By the temperature tower moving lights taste like

          water is key. Special features shared with the land and transparent
          pee. Curing our sight with magic mushrooms, for how long will the
          lights stay on? Who gets to decide the beginning of the day? Not me.

          I could easily drive tomorrow away, no rush. And no pressure. Aided by
          the wind, where is the water going? In its permanent wetness does it
          know or is it coatable? The water replies

          All the water is the same, one large body of moving stillness
          endangered by precarious heat. Thin line pebble game. How would you
          call a mountain dolphin? Not me. How would you know it's your turn to
          decide? Put on the forth speed and let it go, soon you will think of
          nothing else. There is something special about telecommunications:
          there is a flower, the biggest in the world, the size of a forest,
          creeping through every hole - the water replies. There is something
          about the weather, how you can talk about it for so long and with
          anybody, as a universal pacifier. The air is all the same, so how can
          you feel so unique?

          hands, my nose, searching for your name. On the other side of the

          must be because of the cold or teenage hood. Three leaf clovers

          quality. Like pink instead of blue or vice versa. Like small instead
          of big or now instead of never. He had the piercing you like but she
          left the working pants home. He had the hands i've heard about and the

          bothering you? We can always extend to a flesh-light, cheating simply.
          Or there would be no game. We never got hurt, physically. There will

          chest? Or in the place where my chest was before all this wind? I
          don't want answers, honestly. Just to make you closer. As they sat her
          by the water we have to wonder what is it that she wants. Blue road
          coming up soon. No next stop on the moon calendar. No poetry without
          harsh conditions: will my chest survive to this operation? Moving
          elements are key. Gambling with all seems perfect, everywhere there is
          a lack for something, you know? If it gets used to our presence, it
          will make a bed for us, it is only gravity, try it. It's nothing one
          can do but trust. Thrusting into welcoming cracks i come closer to the
          circle of speaking water, wetness being my affinity. It reads,
          continuously. Apply abundantly, and repeat if necessary.

          Maybe we can stage a scene: sliding scale, varying degrees of
          fortunes. Example: open ended foundations.

          mineralization of futures - counting pits between stones sliding scarf
          over the stones. One by one we go, observing alien movement. Sameness
          at the price of discounted connections. Awaiting connector by the end
          of the sentence. A different common denominator: all the plants stay
          outside, all the plans fail to ride. Invest soft strokes

          bring me to tears. There is something about travelling, how you don't
          glance so much into the mirror. At the bar i wonder how my face looks
          like without cue. The arms are soy bean sprouts invested on the trunk
          unwatered. A large pound for growing disaster, a large management for
          small food. Dominant bellies unpierced. Blue looks good on my skin,
          pink look good on its fur. On the zodiac colour advice yellow is the
          warmest colour. Who suits who, who holds the leash today? Am i walking

          something. Brushing against the clock, like every day. Postponing to
          learn the game or to admit we won't go home together tonight. Shining
          bright in the distance, is the ticket you own valid for this ride?
          Rice cracker breakfast, a list of what's extremely there. Four leave
          clove, our main character, missing of course in all our plays

          questions nobody asks. So i let you talk because i've been saying i
          feel fragile, lately. And because the warmth of smoke beats the
          harshness of facts. There's no unknown facts, right? 'Listen' is the
          beginning of the monolog our minds easily forget. One ended
          availability, who dropped the first seed? They will never know i paid
          for tea.
