              who will hold our unity today? we take turns unwillingly, i've
              been saying i feel fragile lately but there is a portal, a purple
              and green one, it is fragile in its greens (dreams) and delicate
              in its purples like something we know. like well tended gardens
              inside steamy soup of soft potato starch flavours. no need for a
              key, its open! a shout to the window and a pack of street cats, i
              walk the street while they play with a stone. mild stoners under
              pink taxi flower blankets laughing christmas away, air
              conditioned, very dry so we compensate. white light blast of wind
              sea salt and macho shield, i already feel better...therapy. your
              nail polish, our main character, a package for two coffees.
              everyone has the right to move. moving on, take it from the top,
              from the tip, of your blue sky nail, cash and carry, no rush it is
              just a code, are you on line? in line with your feelings? clothes
              line and flowery vanilla smells, must be cheap, so i go inside.
              there are three models. where are you going with this? well, i
              think they have working pants. and thats hot. do you wanna ask?
              next stop coming soon, who will step into our intrigue? or will it
              slowly empty out leaving a cold porcelain white lonely bathtub? no
              foam. what is really foam made of? or not really... convince me
              lightly with credible fake facts. it is something hidden at first
              but it is there, already. it doesnt wait, it moves. it is
              stimulated. by the eye without danger? which eye is that? never
              met.
