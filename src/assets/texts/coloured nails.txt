head tilting, riiiiight, falls. up and down, sounds like we're inside a huge fridge but its hot instead and dry and you know how i hate it dry. the white from the outside reminds me we're going places, it almost hurts my eyes, my butt sore, we re inside of a plane, once again, scamming time, with other people, all at once. i wish for no sweat during this transit because i wear the only underpants im carrying, even though we might have a chance to wash, going for clean feelings but also looking forward that wild feel guerrila kid which comes partly from being dirty and/or with the dust that surrounds. we might need a cape to hold us, a silent baby, a new spot in the airport to relax, hospital and cantine feel - temporary. both of the people beside me casually touch me as they move through their butt sore struggle, i realise we are not constrained to our cubicles or we are but we simply don't fit? 'how are we all gonna fit?'

im still into you, you said. i remember the next morning you would get a haircut, one which id never see, maybe it was there on the 'bored at work' selfie you sent me but i couldn't notice. still, bored and lazy, your chosen pronouns. sorry it doesn't work im always moving. move from bed to subway to airplane to car to bus to subway to ferry to every-land. homes, mobile homes. a trailer inside of a an unfinished house. plenty of sun and wind. i think we sunburned. it is december and money allows you to move places, things, islands. land fill, image pile. as you move by all the machos you forget the last time you felt hot, no one looks at you wildly. i could be green. as the days move from one to the other, ten fingers, the nail polish sets a time period. maybe by the end it will be gone like an experienced thought. though  i've never seen stones such colours. all clothes this colour. light watery green-and all the neighbourhood pastels. lets paint my sneakers and your bed sheets, a reminder.

the muscled muscles resting silently on my body, the ability but not the space, you ask me whether i also like fingers inside the mouth, text, im not sure i tell you, depends on the context but also im not having much sex lately. i remember i could put every thing inside you as you would just take it lightly and funky, we d be standing or bending, oiled or lubed, and in the end you'd cook sugary purple cabbage. today you hate men and sugar but i don't think you mean it and i was never a man, maybe just the 'a' inside of the word, a circle, somehow we're so attracted to watching every thing circly, lopped eternally and centred in its own form, all points hanging to the center and the outside, like the kinky black leather circles at the club, how many would fit inside? how could we know the world would be able to make prices for all the things contained in it?

i see a dance floor, i mean every where could be a dance floor but here. on this field of screen i touch specific places to make something, foreplay, eye to eye meets danger but also gazing at the phone. kinda harmless, sadly. un-fortune me as i get myself to transcribe my messages to you that can't be absorbed into your 
existence.

who will hold our unity today? we take turns unwillingly, i've been saying i feel fragile lately but there is a portal, a purple and green one, it is fragile in its greens (dreams) and delicate in its purples like something we know. like well tended gardens inside steamy soup of soft potato starch flavours. no need for a key, its open! a shout to the window and a pack of street cats, i walk the street while they play with a stone. mild stoners under pink taxi flower blankets laughing christmas away, air conditioned, very dry so we compensate. white light blast of wind sea salt and macho shield, i already feel better...therapy. your nail polish, our main character, a package for two coffees. everyone has the right to move. moving on, take it from the top, from the tip, of your blue sky nail, cash and carry, no rush it is just a code, are you on line? in line with your feelings? clothes line and flowery vanilla smells, must be cheap, so i go inside. there are three models. where are you going with this? well, i think they have working pants. and thats hot. do you wanna ask?
next stop coming soon, who will step into our intrigue? or will it slowly empty out leaving a cold porcelain white lonely bathtub? no foam. what is really foam made of? or not really... convince me lightly with credible fake facts. it is something hidden at first but it is there, already. it doesnt wait, it moves. it is stimulated. by the eye without danger? which eye is that? never met.

blasts of ac soundtracking capsule, watery green wind blown blanket, i feel better already. a belly button piercing a hole to be, light purple caress on top of a very clean table top mucous hydration sound cleavage, soft cell gelatine this lamp has pearls. high tech friends gather by the pure water station. tank is full welcome to use. increasing wetness quality coated by rice blatts, it was cold so the sauce became goey. beetroot stained eminem on the shelf i got an orthodox calendar. he was cute he had the piercing i like, what do you say? heavy pancakes mountain goats open the window that will already do: much. are your eyes kissing top and bottom? slowly
closing theres an aperture, it reads: rent a car. light struck by the spati, trekking in contra luz i hear nothing just dill in the nose, who is experimental music now? beetroot soup i dont think i can drive and talk, cuidado, reverse osmosis, est√° apertado, do you see? all we exchange is hello, look! its pink. let me in its raining outside, all we do is us. goat prof plants reaching out for the wind with no intention to leave, tied palm tree with many intentions to live. she's watching us over the napron curtains. off season notice board, announcements of the end of the world. post poned until next summer. babe its happening already, there is no missiles in the water. this silence could not hold their passing through. clothes line, we're washing. i cant belive its 24 degrees in here, but the air sure is dry. voxson and turbox fell asleep, avra cant wait to be turned on

I'm amazed at the light. how can everything be so visible? your restlessness beside me, shuffle and play. mixed referents of mixed feelings, mediums: maybe I'm more into a one night standing (bar?) I feel like I could fall (asleep) at any moment. real time play, live broadcasted accident immediate reaction five second extra point. maybe I too want to be left alone - no trees. perpetually moving I could use a rave to serve as context to my

ring the garlic bell call all the ravers to the front deck reflective lights improvised swimming areas tell them to leave the stones in their pockets, park with your feet  great skills come with habit, olive trees on a date, a life made of habits, tell them to
cover all the signs, olive paste, brushing against the skin like something we know. grabbing a bunch of orange fur pur, scoop a hand of caress. tuned track you chose, too early to go back to sleep. AM / FM / riding on concrete, MTF, using paint that will never dry. successfully excavated everything through which air moves is a flute. do you hear, do you mind? the car plays the mountain, new track with a view. all the creatures join the movement. since before writing because before writing we used to sing. against the dogs in favour of flowers. the temperature tower bears several drums, silently they announce that the boat isn't coming. austere rocks and two small pebbles, solidified in a crust of sea salt by the temperature tower moving lights taste like rain, taste like a soft armpit, as they slowly turn on the studio light as they rapidly descend towards my mouth. how could sky open up and agree? a fortune cookie a cheap treasure from another dimension. three dimensionally constructed by memory. truck swings, will my body remember the wind? nail polish stink high on connectivity, a three man army filling up glass cups, arriving at the roundabout ready to meet, could you tell? bread crumbs improvised eating areas, colourful candy from afar, a toothless smile, pic nik with a K, announcing the instalment of habit, that could be us blinking in the distance settled on stone, in the open, fed by cactus soup: holding water is key. special features, shared with the land and transparent pee. curing our sight with magic mushrooms, for how long will the lights stay on? who gets to decide the beginning of the day? not me.

i could easily drive tomorrow away, no rush. and no pressure. aided by the wind where is the water going? in its permanent wetness does it know or is it coatable? the water replies. drop drop drop all the water is the same, one large body of moving stillness endangered by precarious heat. thin line pebble game. how would you call a mountain dolphin? not me. how would you know its your turn to decide, put on the forth speed and let it go. soon you will think of nothing else. there is something special about telecomunications, there is a flower, the biggest in the world, the size of a forest, creeping through every hole, the water replies. there is something about the weather, how you can talk about it for so long and with anybody as a universal pacifier: the air is all the same, so how can you feel so unique? spaceship materiology, small talk diploma, everyone agrees. when you ring the flower bell take care of its stalk, notice the lemon and how it runs. its just a code, memorise the 4 digits, in three days everyone will be nice. the air bag light is on and im a great driver anyway. solar panel fields technology plantation. note: a honk, hello. another circle. seven small beeps followed by one long beep, an emergency. scratch my eye for me i will imagine it works. getting used to the island, three legy dog. whats your favourite drug. green house restaurant, delicious steamy food, sauna feeling, your fingers in my mouth or mines dipped in aubergine, no sex at the table while the grandmother is around, do you copy? i forgot we might have to go back, probably through where we came from. telefone operator, tell me who is available at this time? do you have a yellow car? whats up with all the gates, guide me to paradise beach, no touching. is this like a very dangerous route?

you connect easily and attach hardly - you are such an eduring professional! salt water tree, it's OK, it's very far from the ocean - a different sort of quality. rock pile, freaks around, bay we're watching. ice cream struck wreck infinite salad, a job with a view. a jaw for a banana, chewy street slang. two phillipine brothers at the mouth of the u-bahn. a handful of candy, two stops so far. an A class long distance house hold utilities romance. 

blue road

the water replies: slash slash slash

a distressed kiss is nothing else but now. 

drunken waves straight edge fish. foam, loads of it, again, against your bare back and my gasping anonimity, remember the honk and turn at the signal. an ass of working pants the candles crowning the road and we're fine, right here is ... odorless suspicion without coverage nor guilt. is this pure teenage thought? a blast from the past plastic animals on an earing hanging from car mirrors - too fun to drive. thirsty site along the horizon.

I couldn't be happier to be alone in this room full of strangers and cheap rock and roll staring into our smart-phones. I'm a vegan cook and a writer, an artist and a lesbian*: are there any of these around? how much % match can be found inside this strangely familiar cloud? we drink and smoke the same hard warm drinks, we talk alien languages but all the objects in this room are the same, as always. feed me plant based treats and rub your pussy on mine, with as much desire as you eat across the table next to that old guy* - strangers are an essential part of the scenery. stare back please, I bring the window with me and its big enough for two, or three. great big smile, effective macho shield, I already feel better... it's been a long long ride, how much will you charge me for this drink? and with how many more smokes can I buy your company? many time I thought of selling sex, never about buying... but if that's the only currency available right now, we might give it a shot: one long shot of moving landscape, for free. do our fingers touch through our screens? is that a selfie you are taking? do you have a dating app profile? (while you speak out in unison) - feed me cheap easy going indie rock songs to make me feel home: where was that again? not at a bar... but then again? last sip, time to move? let's be honest: no one will talk to me. there are too many screens in the room.

this huge rock we're standing on - stone resting on water. are you in the mood? drops drops on the cracks, can you type? blew blue, blue road: what were you? and how did i respond, to your distressed kiss? i bend down trying to understand, what are you? and why is the music so loud? using my hands, my nose, searching for your name. on the other side of the mountain we hide, not hiding. those two seem to have forgotten what natural could mean too outside of (the ... / such and such) context: like water like portals like the plastic bag full of dark greens i'm looking at, struggling to fit. overloading my mouth. a leaf scratching my cheek as i chew, friendly cuts i will sew it up with pink. pink purple super power, no one seems to wear these. when you search for shelter one shade lighter, belly button of the moon, one piercing now hiding must be because of the cold or teenagehood. three leaf clovers showered in yellow: being unlucky is not a thing. just another sort of quality. like pink instead of blue or vice versa. like small instead of big or now instead of never. he had the piercing you like but she left the working pants home. he had the hands i've heard about and the unavailibility we're all wandering around. shared decisions three second check in all around the world, never after 12. the first day - how are you gonna get down? again. if my eyes can get used to the light, what's bothering you? we can always extend to a flesh-light, cheating simply. or there would be no game. we never got hurt, physically. there will always be something with your body, something else but now. all the windows, windmills and fragrant hybrids naturally everything that happens can be. where do all the sensations go, once sensated? and what is the plural of one? is it stored in my chest? or in the place where my chest was before all this wind? i don't want answers, honestly. just to make you closer. as they sat her by the water we have to wonder what is it that she wants. blue road coming up soon. no next stop on the moon calendar. no poetry without harsh conditions: will my chest survive to this operation? moving elements are key. gambling with all seems perfect, everywhere there is a lack for something, you know? if it gets used to our presence, it will make a bed for us, it is only gravity, try it. it's nothing one can do but trust. thrusting into welcoming cracks i come closer to the circle of speaking water. wetness being my affinity. it reads, continuously. apply abundantly, and repeat if necessary.

crossing paths, canela smells, sharing the heating system shared household utilities no washing machine. i miss sleeping with no clothes, the connection from upper to lower free to balance and find itself again in the horizontal no moving moving stillness of sleep. i miss having other than casual texting. topping food feels like luxury now, it means staying at one place for more than x time one dwells into the shelves of food toppers, making life more crunchy tasty colourful and strangely healthy like something we know.

the hands so dry they're soft fabric washed and washed over and over again by the trapping sea that must be tripping, no traffic these days no willingness could take us. we sail the hands of an angel that points us the way the hands so big they could take us away, four seconds. for years abandonment reins, it feels like home, we look at each other we are all here. suddenly it is visible and everyone seems to accept it somehow, you're in the arms of (something), you will leave when (something) wants you to. this trip i can't help but to make parallels with things, i can't help really, not now. swarms of people, a perfect blonde, man - not the one you see, perceptions are a key different to you and me. sun hits away. out of path, big expo of people, offers up to an inclination of 40%, i drive these feet hammered by a declination of flowery vanilla tees, no smell at all - it is still warm though. i wonder if anyone is there. drag living living a drag. a mountain of course i told you so many times this is important. plug in, inside. im starting to like sleeping bags. but it is tight, in there. i find a church and think of all its hidden shelves, how could you trust such architecture. what about thrusting uneven surfaces? have you noticed there's no sharp edges on you and me. but smell of macho all around, deodorant ads live, selling sex simply, for free. Information tower, please share coordinations. i wish for rupture, water hoses around the field the greenest spot in mountain. here and there we miss the tracks, universal space dislocations. like this morning, i was just around and we could not see. just different words to say the same, the catalogue so big we chose randomly, people ask how come, elephant penis plant here and there, water - streethold utilities. a bench, where are you? 24 word game, house tree a view you and me. no capacity limit, who will hold our unity today? who will step into your wet intrigue? the cigarette paper misses the fire, its over it means. time for food? feeding aspirations, happy new year. sorry for the small chosen words, dialogue can only broaden it and i've been saying i feel lonely lately. im writing high on living and i've left places, there hasn't been enough to learn the new language so i try everytime using the old cracked screen. moving on. a deserted swimming pool, a guard afar, holding waters is hard - let go my dear. christmas plant on the forest, space invader. groups come and go, silent click, we're travelling to a soundless era, no reeks. the lentils taste better today, how is your mouth lately? is it possible to understand a city by a high point? what do you really see? looking afar always, breakfast light eye connection to sky creeks wherever they spawn. trying to search for clues i find heart shaped protuberances or holes in the other mountains, there still. all the tourists are straight, im glad. i would never join the group but what are the visiting queers named? visiting queers. babes who can afford. the hassle of being forever visiting. this world is not for us yet we're here as truly as we can, here still. coming down, smiling to a hot anarcobabe, thick septum ring, i already feel better. the lights on a cafe, i like the ones that simulate a drip better, let fall or be so wet as to shed small drops of liquid, google says. he can be a poet too, we are one, techflower that learned to type long ago, attractive, one mountain has sides, a massive transparent potato-starch noodle up and around our brains gathering all our texts as we aim fully at the ground as we write fully to the sky, eye-connected inter faces. shades of party, music genres ending in wave and a jacket with a chest, jasmin tea is delicious sit with me until our skins turn to dust. ground floor, here we are honeys, new entries, no one stops at the red we have different outfits, you wear anarchic black, we share infits, note the scarf it is not a shield but a bed, try it, it is only gravity. if you let go it will hold, im skinnier now - the pants dropping, my ass coming to an opening, no problem. hey, hey, your turn.

rest your head, between the power sockets. rest your tongue before you speak. you are here, after all, carefully curated locations. black brown fur repels water, according to the dictionary. a library of archived miscommunication. transparent green car color, how can you choose? collect availability, hat for three, loud speak no flaps for sharing. hunting basement fermented clay soup flower tea edible talk. stalking across, will you step out of my dreams? light ranting karaoke TV. by the end everyone can scream: it's over. we go out our bag is bluer than the sky and everyone on thus square seems to know it too. would you... we have to go. stay warm, stay cool. what's up with the palm trees? adjustment for every season. mandarine loving clementine: what's your hairdresser name? is that a post box? and does that make this an address? crossdressers waiting for the water to boil brain squad one missing,/pearl element ground TV olfative warnings and soundless cuisine. before thinking in peaks researching terminology. badly nourished looking date, it boils my fantasies. off topic commentary, transparent food, visible desire how much variety can one spoon entail? cheap apartments under feeling names

maybe we can stage a scene: sliding scale, varying degrees of fortunes. example: open ended foundations. olive wall boganvilia basket. a very flexible type of wood, before a prize for honey. premium subscription travelling light over water, mineralization of futures - counting pits between stones sliding scarf over the stones. one by one we go observing alien movement. sameness at the price of discounted connections. awaiting connector by the end of the sentence. a different common denominator: all the plants stay outside, all the plans fail to ride. invest soft strokes bite second bring me to tears. there is something about travelling how you don't glance so much into the mirror. at the bar i wonder how my face looks like without cue. the arms are soy beans sprouts invested on the trunk unwatered. a large pound for growing disaster, a large management for small food. dominant bellies unpierced. blue looks good on my skin. pink look good on its fur. on the zodiac colour advice yellow is the warmest colour. who suit who, who holds the leash today? am i walking you? rich oils sanding paper for skin. sweat apple colour bones you asked and they said yes. no worries, or something. brushing against the clock, like every day. postponing to learn the game or to admit we won't go home together tonight. shining bright in the distance is the ticket you own valid for this ride? rice cracker breakfast a list of what's extremely there. four leave clove, our main character, missing of course. in all our plays scripted, of course, like something we know. all things being equal, the street is empty and so i slide my tongue along the way. unsharp scissors a shoe and glue, very quick. overnight, just to be sure. everyone speaks qualities understating questions nobody asks. so i let you talk because i've saying i feel fragile, lately. and because the warmth of smoke beats the harshness of facts. there's no unknown facts, right? listen, is the beginning of the monolog our minds easily forget. one ended availability, who dropped the first seed? she will never know i paid for tea.

street and houseplants all angry at the mechanic, if you dont wanna write, thats fine. we can pick up where we left from. moving backwards they could never foresee the cats like us but the people don't. moved by green aesthetics unbore me says the view. city clementines, indoor climate change, hosted by triangle seats turning pyramids to cakes. there are too many screens its the celebration of global disconnection. point your arm forward and breathe deeply, hold the rubber band firmly, move your tongue, its ok non sense day, bordered up - rationality is a man's thing anyway. tax free, a honk beyond the point of no return, sexy ethnics politically incorrectness, spy on the closest passenger a visible face fading out misery. how can you put an ass in an envelope? who will hold my bottom today? express delivery funnelling vortex underlined words red green yellow, no pink. dolphin transportation, a dark blanket of clouds -

we didn't talk about numbers, you know, that's not our kind of conversation. soft grey hued anarchism, do you know where we are? the heat coming out my ears. a sign coming out the wall. coming out is never easy. jumping, suicide. how many stars do you see? coordinated legs moves, exaggerated eye contact. breath suspension while feeling the muscles. here and there we share habits. lay down on the matt you say we never meet in public spaces. I'd rather scroll down your chest making a turn on the armpit while you find my belly button. synchronised perversities, dance moves on the, matt underwater currency: now let's do a flow, pretending to speak the language. to know what's going on. memory for punctuation. brain piercing smaller glass shots: measurments no fair division. pink coloured bags: recenter location. I turn the compass to you a let you loose the keys to control. five lighters at the price of three, information tower, tell me: how steep is the way? slurping sounds of pleasure rudeness is not a thing. a high overpass the sound of nothing. note number now, a poster a film and the smell. you are never loosing, missing is a part of gaming. fewer lesser conjugations make a song easier to hear. on your forehead I read sun spots and I'm hungry too. limping away

strangely familiar yet unrecognisable. chimes in the wind. nothing will ever stay the same. there's nothing specific about that change. flooded road wet asphalt. for every zone a hidden happening. you can only whistle in one way. all around the metro station cobertura de bolo . there is something about the rain, how it runs down and along the streets of steep dirt and flat possibility. 21st century sci-fi is so low-tech, it must be hot with the aliens... new age filter on your photo sharing app believing is a matter of collectivity: I'm ready to go hone.

rogue state grab my waist wearing nothing but a feathered-vest, fake friendly simulation test driving towards the farthest enemy, ground floor, check-in, dancing throughout the way rushing the sun-clock ticks burns and cleans all the mould accumulated in my mildly hardened heart, is this snow blue and an old hue reflection on the car i like, the main character i wonder about texting but words im tired of casualness, send a pic and decipher it yourself, tons of combinations possible, free coding, brain builder, using nothing else but parallel leaves on a stick fallen on the floor, this lamp, organisation was never it, look down  we were simply chasing beauty.  what you looking for? break down beats ride my fingers looking afar i see snow - real snow no poetics involved just alien construction because we the ones, whats the plural of one? are right at the bottom, weeds but extending arms to the atmosphere take it out and in spatial aerated lounge zone a trio of pyramid sugar coating legs leggy shot acrobating a job and a fuck what to do? streaks of inspiration whats my diet? on a flowery plate spat sun squat on the mountain wireless queer melody oh yeah right in the outskirts of the city eternal paradise beach, theres water theres life, pace accelerating see what i wanna see unagreed colab. expensive ruin still no funds strobe lights working outdoor department, cruising trees raving messiah all awaken by my perception, dreaming of every trans passer theres so much space take me there a little closer. i grab my mother's hand taking you places, blood shared strength climbing a rock coming out as what? im so much i could tell you an uneven story as the thread in my jacket swirls around the washing machine wrinkled oks, ready to go ready to ride. nylon is not biodegradable and will persist in the environment indefinitely, 2 euros for a world-long-life, 2 streets directed at the sea, a port no bigger than 2 thumbs, a jogger split in two, sexual reverse positions today i dreamt of penetration how my ass healed in time for departure. how you never remembered any of it. ping pong for two minutes. clean hairy bush, do you know the smell of air-dried clothes? nothing in this makes sense so what's up with all the theories? invest in success of plug-ability, a happy trail of pistachio skin, must have been fun that time when snails and shells found each other and swirled in the ever-same mediterranean shore, the moon has another powers here. how could we invent plastic but not the words to tell you how i feel? the next performer will just jump in, anyway i think this is what they meant by reaching out.

surveilled ruins but first lets take in all but the body parts accounting to sexyness according to other than legislation. on the lesbian kiosk grammar by the cent, a fridge color, an illegal trash pick-up, transported over the hill this boat was pulled by rope and a material yet to see. athletics of power all the bugs got killed in the way, anyway who can deal with disaster? stones and buildings look the same under the sun, says the mechanical eye? the best view of the century happens at the very ground level. minty lipstick chain smoking kiss, i would lick off the non vegan left overs on your teeth. inhaled disaster, prof-read compilation. unsustainable law of attraction. look what i bought! and look what i found! pools of solar panels, bet against the clouds. the AC replies drop drop splash. dealing pressures was never easy. all the heat stuck on the upper part of the room. uninteresting formations, the decay breaks, rose water dropping down the nipple, not any nipple but this. the third eye on a holiday, the space between us is blue. mountain range dilemma. droplets guide the way, since you can't eat bread. i will lick your feet. delicious spider rolls missing opening hours. empty dining table, or rather table. for no one in particular can hold the opportunity. lacking is not a thing. shrivelled hands on a date, sharp nails awake your body temperature. cast of love, i dont want to hire you. throw something in the middle, like correspondence. new born availability, sun set shots burning your throat track. time is a human condition. allowing for the last four percent. maybe next time.

lube up your nostrils and stop pretending you're into stuff you can't see. massage the melon in the bowl, a future is ahead you think. car honks and collateral vibrations, sizzling patatas bravas suck on this fragmented reality. rave off apathy support leaning stalks. do you know what's an alocasia? you know it needs feeding, right? pull on my sleave but pause at the pole. books were never it, it was more the nail polish on the page. w thinks in wipping wallets terms. will the police take my house shoes? not the astronaut boots, please. sci-fi in the 21st century is so low-tech. I wonder what they're like on e. or excited, in general. shaved off side burns tear down the window blinds. half bent desire high on hunger, no games. if that's OK? canons inclination hold a declination I don't remember the last time the ground was paralele to a line we picture at earth's core. asphalt against sky, balcony against whose gonna stain my sports jacket? how's the sports in the clouds? I ask the tower operator. does the ball bounce or fall? three dimension is bullshit, a multimedia happening. a full on spectrum, a party only goes three places: the fourth, your room, the last stop of the cycle. boys are dumb.

dry the air and everyone will fall. i close my eyes afraid of functioning, plugging in silent mode, low energy, frequencies and all those air-from-an-architecture-studio like atmospheric phenomenons, endless photocopying, a room. i discovered a new closeness to clouds, a deeper logic to my elements but this aircraft a space invader a very necessary exit, armed by unknown people. no animal was killed. stuffing clothes and hiding bombs, my brain fuming, a different ignition. stuff and hold, repetitions, you have cute socks and smile by my presence, emergency exit an unimportant notice, purple slides and green tops, the blue Trousers and socks light sea green, the ones i got you. sameness from afar. sea fortune. fortunate circles. wheat stomping agreeing on a diet, daily stapling rice cracker, soft teeth, gone flaky over the hammering of possibilities of turns and tickets, of endless filtration water degustation, words lost any agency power to the last sense, mint cardamon leaves, z√© will be happy we can drink again. grey return, a small dislocation.

you can't wait for your gluten-free treats, all the soy products at the super market. all the fucking hippies, in the end, no one is ever nice. sleeping with your mouth open in public space, transportation of desire trafficking of potentially broken hearts - you need a smoke. half dreaming half serious about a portable aerial smoking aquarium, you need to pee. sun bathing in ac drought where is the closest exit? so often, behind you. borrowed head lines down with hierarchies and why not a soft kiss growing towards abrupt surprise: you never bite first. linger on my eye I will travel to your breath, too many layers of jackets and sun, my hand right in on the curvy edge. I imagine all the sweat produced by cleaning products and unheated misery, I would gladly climb inside your cold shared bed smoking boredom and nihilism waiting for the flight. you're not on the menu, but still as sexy as always, tinted with unavailability. we're all holding back and leaning on each others fears on this track of the mountain or that person inside with the dogs, why won't she let us in? do you wanna go around, until we find the entrance? I don't mind, but could someone please turn the ventilation on drying all the water in my body, including tears. jump over the neighbouring passager my smartphone tries to read my mind and I masturbate on the bus vibration instead. there is not enough lube on this port, all the eyes so dry unchanging gazing at the screen counting down the time for arrival. if you pull I won't push just use your voice to indicate direction and be precise about the minutes. walk in, step down, remain un-noticed if convenient and dreams as much as you like of everything that will never happen - as long as it won't drive you mad. last moments before landing I can't sustain the fight against addiction, record your voice and talk me into sleep feeding on ideas of collectivity and breaking down ground parts for something like water or maybe fire or just a very small vegetable existence to protrude, inwards. mixed up pet names never ending first dates and uneasy messages wondering about the entrance or the endurance professional on the window shopping for some action on the discounted items section. three foreign languages and still counting, distinct origins of alphabets fastened under your cultural mistake. what do you know about doubt except for time and genetics so next time bring a book and choose a warmer destination for your frustration towards humanity. hallucination stays beside you all while life can be pulled from under the seat at the foreign boarder and costumes department all the guards wear gel nails and the taller have teeth piercings: you can get yours at your dentist. grinder protection only works once you're filming and all of this for money? it's possible to learn, depending on who you ask. I'm sure the driver can't see, being guided by game-like birds-eye-view screens where we're only represented against the closest menacing obstacle. I wonder about birds and how they learn to avoid certain rotating machines, how we are not to trust and even the creatures who share the sun can't find their ways towards each other in this mess of GPS beeps. a sensual triangulation between hopelessness aesthetics and superstition - boredom ain't an affinity. press gently your brain on my back thigh send signals through my nerves on this day slip between sunny and grey. reality has never been so constructed, at the inversion point of the look out where everyone knows you can buy weed. maybe there is an image awaiting for this knowledge, the sun is undeniably there, regardless of the clouds and the things you said and let others say, silently. the weather is all the same, above a certain latitude and the goats or the swans will keep reproducing without permission because you can't count the trees either way. the elements of the balance too far for the eyes reach and I'm glad we're forgetting all the time all the things. everything could be so pretty but who should ever hold the right to control? I kind of like this images of never ending flatness moving landscape, for free. the fact is I can't handle being the connection point for these two, so for us to continue this side down and cautious with the inflatable areas. welcome back to our reality, it is, hard on its greys and sharp on its hues of redness without control. an eye for loneliness traveling in duos take me to the inhalation area of such growth. doesn't mean anything anyway any time now you'll step out of the aircraft after the trio with the cool shaped hairs. or maybe i'm on my own and forgot to check the app for

I could have seen you everyday for three days, your slowness makes sense to my speed lined impulse - even if I'm attracted and horny... I feel you, answers the small tube curled around your hear. abrupt changes of flow trying to hold on to the last line, everything is wet on this side of the aquarium. this step the perfect dimension to my hanging one afternoon stand I wonder if you're into. yesterday I went to the super market but couldn't find any taste on the discounted shelf affinities. there were no drones in the island and the aliens enjoy our quietness too. mind recording devices for a society without any loosing for shower thoughts or maybe drains. bleach your dominance color it in as many colours as the shops offers. wrap your cigarette but on a rotten leaf of absence is not a thing. foreign manipulation of vocabulary dissident prepositions floating by the dusty curtains sewed back together croocked on two different colours. what else is not a thing? a date with your new jacket fusing moods against distinct back drops running parallel time lines. if the wind stops to blow how can we know it's coming and do all those heads think of the scenery? it might work both ways and while you feel no rush clocks ticking everyone is glad
